# Admin-managed-user-access
Admin creates users and assigns userids and passwords for the same. The user logs in using the same and gives its name and uploads an image from their device. Images can be cropped with the help of copper.js. The names and images get saved against their ids in MongoDB. All users' information can be viewed in the form of a table by the admin.
